Mainly intended to rescale assets from different sources (out of scale CAD imports, models from engineering software..)

* Units:

Current size of the object will be interpreted as X [cm/inch] per max unit.

* Factor:

1:100
Means that one drawing unit represents one hundred real units. in the context of the tool, one unit of the object will be transformed in 0.1 max units.

1. Pick a reference point, it will act as a *center* of the *orthogonal space*.
2. Move the mouse around to change the direction or snap to a point. Hold **CTRL** during axis selection to lock the position of the XY plane.

* Hold **SHIFT** at tool start for continued mode.
* Hold **SHIFT** during creation for orthogonal track.
* Hold **ALT** while tracking position to override intersection points toggle.

The line guide is divided in points that can be used as snap targets. The distance of the marks can be set on the modifier panel.

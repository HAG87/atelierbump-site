1. Select the vertices you want to align. alternatively, select a edge loop or some consecutive edges.
2. Start the tool. Choose a base point to begin drawing a line that will be used to align the vertices.
3. Choose an endpoint to determine the direction of the line.

The vertices will be repositioned over the line, to the closest point to the original position.

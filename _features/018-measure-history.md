The Distance measure history dialog keeps track of performed measures, allowing to re-display them and customize appearance.

It can also be used to **create renderable dimension lines** with measure annotation. Standard Spline and text shapes will be created to draw the dimension line.

### Notice

* Please note that the text will be oriented left -&gt; right, based on the current view.
* The tool is designed to be use in the perspective viewport. Expect unpredicted result in orthogonal views.

**Per-Camera resolution**
When you change the resolution and aspect ratio it will be stored in the camera, and the tool will automatically change the render output accordingly when cycling throw the cameras.
Note that the tool will change the render output and will keep the last setting if you exit the tool.

**Reviewing cameras**
Use "Refresh" update the list if the scene changes.
Use the "Select" to select the active camera.

**Per-camera output preview**
Activate it to use the render output set for the camera when changing the camera with the 3ds Max dialog (CTRL+C).

**Batch render rollout**
After setting the *output path* one time, the tool will auto format the *file name* and *output path* for the next views.

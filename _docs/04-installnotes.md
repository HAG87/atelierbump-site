## To install *DesignToolBox* under multiple 3ds Max versions

Run the installer each time choosing the corresponding 3ds max installation folder. Opt-out when the installer prompts to uninstall previous version.

## Uninstall

When you want to uninstall the tool, the installer will only remove the last iteration.
The procedure in this case is to **re-install the plugin in the 3ds Max version you want to remove it, and then uninstall again**.

## Manual remove

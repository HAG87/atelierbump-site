* Entirely rewritten Array tools
Besides setting up a framework that allows to expand the tools feature sets, these are the changes for now:
  * 2D Array: If you press SHIFT when executing the tool, the object will be cloned to the grid cells instead. Also a new Macro was added to use this mode: 2D Array - grid cells.
  * Pattern Array:
    * Simplified the UI, just one button to add/update the row-column rule.
    * Major enhancement and performance improvement in some cases.
* Paneling tool: Replaced the tool completely; the results will be the same, but is easier to use and follows the same mechanics that the 2D Array tool. For how-to-use, refer to the user guide.
* Replaced the "Welcome" dialog with some more useful information for new users.
* Some general optimizations all over the place, some tools should work faster in some cases.

### Added

* Stamp tool: Use an object to Interactively stamp its shape or cut holes in a mesh.
